# diskspd-benchmark-tools
Some quick powershell scripts to aid in disk benchmarking using the diskspd tool.
2 scripts, one to run diskspd with a set of 3 different tests and capture the results in
a series of timestamped files.  The second script takes a directory of these files and
parses them in to a csv file for easier analasys in a spreadsheet or similar application.

## disk-benchmark.ps1
The test script, inteneded to be run on a regualr basis from something like Windows task
scheduler.  The script randomly determins if it should run the test and by default will do
this 60% of the time, this can be changed with a config variable however.

## parse-benchmarkresults.ps1
Takes ths files generated by disk-benchmark and puts them in to a csv file.
